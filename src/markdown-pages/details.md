## Other things

### Dress

Get fancy, but have some fun with it. Think: summer disco.

### About the space

The ceremony and reception will both be held in [The Bindery](https://www.mcminnvillebindery.com/), which _is_ an indoor venue, but we're planning on having the big garage bay door open during the reception. After the ceremony, we'll be outside for the cocktail hour under a tent while we flip the space for the reception.

### Lodging

If you're still looking for lodging, here's a few options:

- [Hotel Oregon](https://www.mcmenamins.com/hotel-oregon): This is right downtown and super close to the venue. We can't reserve rooms, so it's first come first serve.
- [Comfort Inn](https://www.choicehotels.com/oregon/mcminnville/comfort-inn-hotels/or177): We also have a block of rooms reserved at the Comfort Inn, which is about 1.5 miles from the venue. To book here, just call them and give them our names.
- [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/McMinnville--OR--United-States/homes?tab_id=home_tab&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&flexible_trip_dates%5B%5D=december&flexible_trip_dates%5B%5D=november&flexible_trip_lengths%5B%5D=weekend_trip&date_picker_type=calendar&query=McMinnville%2C%20OR%2C%20United%20States&place_id=ChIJo3PJF7dOlVQRSM9F2xtwRMo&checkin=2022-06-03&checkout=2022-06-05): And of course there's a bunch of Airbnbs, both in McMinnville and surrounding areas.
