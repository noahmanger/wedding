We really recommend everyone jump on booking a place to stay as soon as possible. McMinnville is a small town that sees a lot of tourists in the summer and we know there's already another wedding happening this weekend.

We'll have some sort of _something_ on the Friday night before, so we recommend getting a place for Friday and Saturday nights, June 3-4.

## Options

- **[Atticus Hotel](https://atticushotel.com/):** If you're feeling fancy, we've booked 13 rooms at the Atticus Hotel for Friday and Saturday nights. The Atticus is right across the street from the venue, and rooms are ~$450/night. If you want one of these, just let us know and we'll hook you up. ü§ôüèº
- **[Hotel Oregon](https://www.mcmenamins.com/hotel-oregon)**: This is right downtown and super close to the venue. We can't reserve rooms, so it's first come first serve.
- **[Comfort Inn](https://www.choicehotels.com/oregon/mcminnville/comfort-inn-hotels/or177):** We also have a block of rooms reserved at the Comfort Inn, which is about 1.5 miles from the venue. To book here, use
