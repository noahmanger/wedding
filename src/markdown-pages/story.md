**2019** We moved in together a year later, and were pleasantly surprised to find our, um, _contrasting_ styles actually worked together quite harmoniously. We balanced nesting with travel—taking trips to Mexico and Spain—and learned that not only could we make great roommates, but we're even better travel buddies.
